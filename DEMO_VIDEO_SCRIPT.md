Let's say you're creating content about 'Personal Finance for Millennials.' You simply type that in here, and the AI instantly understands your niche.

**[VISUAL: AI processing indicator]**

The AI doesn't judge your niche. It doesn't care if it's popular or not. It just needs to know what you're creating content about so it can find the right viral patterns.

**[VISUAL: Niche confirmation screen]**

And that's it! Step 1 is complete. The AI now knows exactly what type of content you want to create.

But here's where it gets really exciting..."
